    <h1>Favorite Animal </h1>
    
    <img href="dog.jpg">
    <p>My favorite animal is a dog. I like dogs because they are fluffy. I also like dogs because you can pet some of them and they will not bite . Sometimes they will bite. I also like dogs because they can be different sizes and different breeds. 
    They are sometimes nice and they can also be mean. But they are normally nice. I only like nice dogs because they do not hurt you.
